# Data Types in Java? You're in for a treat..
Well, not the good kind but maybe you'll like it, I'll let you be the judge. Java is used commercially for a lot of time, there must be a reason, **there has to be a reason**. Java is STRONGLY TYPED (no,not typing with caps), but having an explicit type declaration makes the program more easier to manage in the long run. 

```java
int myDepression = 1/0; //Don't do this
float myGpa = 3.8;
String myFavoriteGame = "Red Dead Redemption 2";
```
