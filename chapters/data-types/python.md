# Data Types? What does that even mean
Programs operate on different types of data, And each data type allows you to perform certain operations on them. For example you can add two numbers (*surprise, surprise*), or store a list of items you want to do but never get around to actually doing it and you ignore it hoping it goes away but then it comes back to haunt you and now you have no choice but to work on it at two am, so yeah you can store a list of items too.

## Types? Why Should you care, you never needed them before
Remeber kid, I was like you once but you gotta trust me on this one, if you don't manage your types properly especially in python your code base becomes a spaghetti mess, Python has dynamic typing which means you don't have to explicitly assign a type to any variable unlike some other *languages*. Sure the code would look simple but that has its cons too, as you'll see in the upcoming chapters

## Enough's Enough, wHaT aRe ThEy?
## Strings
Simple, What do you call yourself? Surely you must have a readable human name, unless you're eleven

So anytime you use a text it is a string, a string in python is declared as
```python
name = "eleven"
another_name = "Arthur"
my_favorite_game = "Fallout 76" #That's not true don't come at me
```

## Numbers
If you went to buy groceries and asked the shopkeeper, give me some money or I'll shoot. If the shopkeeper is a student who works at minimum wage they'll hand you the money and call 911, but if they are the owner and their lively hood depends on that money they will ask you how much? Be specific don't say 'I want some/all the money they got' he has kids too you know, so say 50.35$ and both of you can go home safe

In both cases ```911``` is a number, and ```50.35``` is also a number. 911 is an integer while currency has two decimal places, it doesn't matter if its stolen or not, Money is money. You do you
